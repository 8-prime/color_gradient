        To generate a gradient pick two starting colors. these are currently defined through
        the variables r1..b1 and r2..b2. 
        Then based on the width of the image and the colorspace(rbg with 8 bit) calculate
        how many pixels shoudl be colored in the the color before moving on to the next color. 
        The variable holding this information is incremented after each pass of n written rows
        It is applied to all three color values r, g and b and these are saved in cu?


        have to have the x value for the fomular saved as maybe weight in a float and incremented by 
        1 / 255 as a float.

        whith the weight then calculate the current color to be drawn for the stepsize of pixels and then 
        with the next iteration increment the weight by 1/255 again.
